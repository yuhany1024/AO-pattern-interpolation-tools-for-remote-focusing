These files implement the algorithm of zonal approach for AO patterns interpolation. The txt files in the test folder can be used to test the code. They store the information of phase gradient (in the unit of gray level) directly measured from experiments. The scale of Zernike defocus is indicated by the names.

AO_interpolation_zonal.m is the main script that can be run directly.
